                effective method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and
                maximize efficiency (or flow).

            <div class="font-Inter-400 text-color-000000 text">
              Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use
              <span class="join-span"><a href="../index.html">Join</a> </span>:

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <h2>Exploring the Board</h2>
                  When you log in to
                  <span class="join-span"
                    ><a href="../index.html">Join</a> </span
                  >, you'll find a default board. This represents your project
                  and contains four default lists: "To-Do", "In Progress",
                  "Await feedback" and "Done".
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h2>Creating Contacts</h2>
                  In
                  <span class="join-span"
                    ><a href="../index.html">Join</a> </span
                  >, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to
                  the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in
                  the required information. Once added, these contacts can be
                  assigne dtasks and the ycan interact with the tasks on the
                  board.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h2>Adding cards</h2>
                  Now that you've added your contacs, you can start adding
                  cards. Cards represents individual tasks. Click the "+" button
                  under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the
                  task details in the card, like task name, description, due
                  date, assignees, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h2>Moving Cards</h2>
                  As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect
                  that on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one
                  list to another.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h2>Deleting Cards</h2>
                  Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done"
                  list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it
                  from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards,
                  as this action is irreversible.
                  <br />
                  Remember that using
                  <span class="join-span"
                    ><a href="../index.html">Join</a>
                  </span>
                  effectively requires consistent updates from you and your team
                  to ensure the board reflects the current state of your
                  project.
